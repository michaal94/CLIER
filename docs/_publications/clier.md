## Abstract

The task of embodied question answering is to provide answers to natural language queries about a visual scene by changing the belief about the scene or physically interacting and changing the scene. We propose a modular closed-loop approach to a combined Visual and Interactive Reasoning for robotic manipulation of object. Our learning-based approach takes into account the measurements of non-visual object properties, changes in the scene caused by external disturbances as well as uncertain outcomes of robotic actions. We develop a simulation environment that makes use of a physics engine and high-quality renderer to provide realistic visual observations that are also accurate to the physical state of the scene. The proposed simulation environment  allows us to generate new, synthetic data composed of 10 classes of multi-step benchmarking scenarios focused on simultaneous visual and physical measurements. We evaluate the reasoning approach extensively in simulation (using the proposed dataset) and in the real world (with YCB-video objects), with a success rate in manipulation tasks above 64\%.
